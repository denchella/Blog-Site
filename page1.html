      <h2>WHY GITHUB IS GOOD</h2>
      <p>Github allows prototyping without out the fear of breaking
        already existing code. This is done with version control and
        things called 'branches'. You can start working on a branch,
        away from the master to try out new features and revert back
        to earlier code if it doesn't go to plan.<br>
        This feature is one of the main ways it has become so easy for
        designers to collaborate and share code and new ideas with one
        another.  </p>

     <h2>HOW I MADE MY HOMEPAGE ACCESSIBLE</h2>
      <p>To make my homepage for Routes accessible I gave each
      component a new section with a class so everything is logical
      if it is being read by a screen reader. I also chose to use
      colours on my wepage that are of high contrast so that they can
      be easily read. Lastly, when zoom is used on my webpage it still
      functions that same, and is easily read and accessible. </p>
